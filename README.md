# Pong

> Pong is a simple "tennis like" game that features two paddles and a ball, the goal is to defeat your opponent by being the first to gain 10 point. A player gets a point once the opponent misses a ball. The [game](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Pong) was originally developed by video game pioneer [Allan Alcorn](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Allan_Alcorn) and released in 1972 by [Atari corporations](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Atari_Corporation).


TODO:

- [ ] Revisit the collision and ball movement logic (it's a bit off)
- [ ] Cleanup (I should re-structure, modularize the codebase üòû)
